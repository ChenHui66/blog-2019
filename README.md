# CRIMX BLOG

A front-end blog built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org).

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment and CDN distribution.
